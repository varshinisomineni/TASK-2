# TASK-2
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# 🚀 AI & ML Internship - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand dataset patterns using summary statistics and visualizations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (interactive)

## 📂 Files in this Repo
- `dataset/Titanic-Dataset.csv` → Raw dataset
- `notebook/EDA.ipynb` → Full code notebook
- `README.md` → Documentation with results

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. **Summary Statistics** → Mean, median, std, missing values, data types  
2. **Histograms & Boxplots** → To visualize distributions and outliers  
3. **Correlation Analysis** → Heatmap & pairplot for feature relationships  
4. **Interactive Visualization** → Plotly for dynamic exploration  
5. **Observations** → Basic feature-level insights  

## 📚 Interview Q&A

1. **What is the purpose of EDA?**  
   - To understand dataset structure, detect anomalies, and extract insights before modeling.  

2. **How do boxplots help?**  
   - Show distribution, median, spread, and outliers of numeric data.  

3. **What is correlation & why useful?**  
   - Measures linear relationship between features (helps detect redundancy or key predictors).  

4. **How to detect skewness?**  
   - Histogram, skewness coefficient, boxplot.  

5. **What is multicollinearity?**  
   - When independent variables are highly correlated, leading to unstable model coefficients.  

6. **What tools for EDA?**  
   - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.  

7. **Example when EDA helped?**  
   - Detecting outliers in Fare/Income before building predictive models.  

8. **Role of visualization in ML?**  
   - Helps interpret data patterns, guides feature engineering, and improves model decisions.  

## ✅ How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open `notebook/EDA.ipynb` in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells step by step  
4. Review summary statistics and plots
